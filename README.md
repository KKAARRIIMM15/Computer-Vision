# Project Describtion
this project is a deep learning algorithm (Mask R-CNN with ResNet-50 backbone with FPN: which Refers to the Feature Pyramid Network)to recognize and segment 
each banknote for calculating the total money in each frame

# Dataset
custom dataset taken by my phone camera

# Methodology
The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition.
Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps
